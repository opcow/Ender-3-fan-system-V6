## Creality Fan Super Air Force System 3000 ZX 7 Platinum Pro Plus Unlimited Edition Mk 3 (UPDATED 2019/2/27)

* Compatible with a 4010/4020/4028 fan for the heat sink and a 5015 blower for part cooling.
* Designed for the Creality Ender 3. Should work on some other Creality Printers.

Changes 2019/02/18:

* Increased adjustment slot length for more upward movement
* Added captive nut slot

This design is more complicated to print than [my other design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3353695), but it has the advantage of giving a really good view of the print nozzle. I think it may cool the heat sink better, due to the better directed air flow, but I haven't tested this.

### Screws Needed

* 3 - M3x6 (2 if not using the turnable nozzle)
* 5 - M3x8-10
* 1 - M4x25
* 1 - M4x20
* 2 - M4x16-?? depending on your fan size
* 1 - M4 nyloc locknut

There is an STL file (nozzle_support.stl) that can be used as support for the plenum area of the turnable blower nozzle. In Cura you would place this on the plate aligned with the nozzle and tell Cura to print it as support. Then you can block all support at the roof inside the nozzle or just tell Cura to only put support that is touching the build plate, which will give you a bit of support inside the nozzle, but it will be easily removable.

### Notes

The fit of the blower bracket in the slot on the plate cap part should be tight. This tight fit is by design, but depending on your printer, it may be too tight to allow the bracket to slide easily in the slot. If the fit is too tight, try working the bracket back and forth in the slot until it loosens up. Sandpaper or a small file may help.

The screw below the cable tie slot is a bit of a pain to get to. I use a magnet to hold it in place until I get it started. I don't reccomend omitting it. The plate cap part should contact the duct base at this screw hole. If there is a gap between them then your plate cap may not be fully seated.

_**Check the blower duct clearance before printing for the first time after installing.**_ Ensure that the plate cap part is fully seated, then loosen the locknut on the back of the blower bracket to allow adjustment by sliding the blower bracket up or down in the slot. Raise or lower the bracket as needed. Lower the nozzle to the bed and check that there is enough clearance between the bed and the duct.
